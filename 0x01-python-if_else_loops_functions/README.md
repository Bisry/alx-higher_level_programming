Python IF, ELIF, and ELSE Statements
In this tutorial, you will learn exclusively about Python if else statements.

While writing code in any language, you will have to control the flow of your program. This is generally the case when there is decision making involved - you will want to execute a certain line of codes if a condition is satisfied, and a different set of code incase it is not. In Python, you have the if, elif and the else statements for this purpose. In this tutorial, you will work with an example to learn about the simple if statement and gradually move on to if-else and then the if-elif-else statements. You will also learn about nesting and see an nested if example. Lets get started....

Simple if statement
This is the simplest example of a conditional statement. The syntax is:

if(condition):
      indented Statement Block

The block of lines indented the same amount after the colon (:) will be executed whenever the condition is TRUE.
